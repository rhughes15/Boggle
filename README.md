# Boggle
Lab 2 for CS351

This is the final version of my Boggle game and it includes almost everything. It starts a timer and 
accepts the input from the board after the game is started, it adds 10 points for every letter in a valid
word in the dictionary, the end game button ends the game, and the change board size button changes the size
of the board. The only two things I would have added if I had time are fixing up the size of the letters 
when the board is larger (it's only made to visually handle a 4x4 board right now) and forcing a more even 
balance between consonants and vowels on the board rather than purely random generation.
